            Hello! My name is Maria. I am a student at the University of
                Nebraska Omaha currently working towards my masters in Management
                Information Systems. I grew up mostly overseas with the military in
                Okinawa, Japan and Pyeongtaek, South Korea.  On my free time, I
                mostly play video games with friends. One of my favorite game franchises
                is called Fallout, there's five or six different games and Amazon Prime
                Video is coming out with a TV show for it in April.
