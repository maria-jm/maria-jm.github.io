        <p>
            I graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in May 2023
                with a bachelor's in Marketing and a minor in National Security
                Studies. I currently am utilizing my National Security and MIS
                background as a research and development assistant at the
                Nebraska Deterrence Lab. Over my academic career, I have had the
                opportunity to collaborate on projects with a number of government
                and defense institutions such as USSTRATCOM, NATO, and the FBI.
